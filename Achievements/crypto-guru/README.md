# Crypto Guru Achievement

# Goal: 

Demonstrate your mastery of crypto protocols by notarizing your player-space's README.md file on a blockchain.

# Explanation of Purpose: 

This demonstrates multiple important skills for our project: 

1. Ability to fingerprint a file using a hashing algorythm.
1. Ability to use a blockchain to notarize a file's integrity
1. Ability to document objective evidence.

# Completion Criteria: 

- Calculate the **SHA256 hash of your README.md**  
- Save the hash in a **README.md.sha256** in your personal repository
- Post the hash to a blockchain of your choice.
- Save a URL to the transaction ID containing your proof in a **README.md.proof** file.
- Create a Pull Request to **update the table below** with links to your evidence.
